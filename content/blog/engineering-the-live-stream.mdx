# Overview

Between September 30th and the LAN finals on November 16th, 
I developed the technical broadcast infrastructure and visual identity for Red Bull M.E.O. 2025 Georgia. 
My goal was to introduce a professional-tier tournament experience to the Georgian PUBG Mobile community, 
implementing technical standards and automation that had not been seen in previous local events.

## The Visual Identity

The first part of the project was about the graphics. 
I used **Photoshop** to take the official Red Bull assets and turn them into a full look for the tournament.

The most important part was that I was in direct contact with the tournament organizers from **Red Bull**. 
They gave me the raw assets and gave me feedback on everything I made. 
We went back and forth until they were happy with the results and approved them.

My goal was simple: make sure the Georgian community got a tournament that looked just as professional 
as the official ones done by PUBG Mobile itself. 
By working closely with the associates, I was able to make sure all the social media posts 
and stream graphics stayed "on brand" while still looking high quality.

To achieve this, I established a visual framework that involved two distinct workflows:

- **Static Design:** Using **Photoshop** to create social media branding and community assets for the Georgian PUBG Mobile scene.
- **Motion Graphics:** Developing a suite of broadcast compositions in **After Effects**. To ensure these weren't just static videos, 
I exported them via **[Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web)**, allowing the animations to be 
controlled and populated by live data in real-time.

## System Architecture

Before this project, I worked on the **Play Card Tournament**, where I first built the tools for broadcast automation. 
For Red Bull M.E.O., I refactored that code to make it more stable and easier to use in a live environment.

The system was built as a multi-service stack to handle three different jobs:

- **Management Suite (Electron, TypeScript)**: I built a desktop application to manage the Lottie assets. 
It allowed me to upload the JSON files and images, then edit text and swap assets on the fly. 
This gave me a "control center" to manage the visuals without touching the code during the event.
- **The Content Server (Express, React)**: I developed a full-stack web application to host the Lottie files and provide an API. 
This acted as the central hub where the graphics were updated and served to the broadcast.
- **The Data Bridge (Flask)**: To get live stats from the game, I made a webserver using **Flask** 
and bundled it into an executable with **PyInstaller**. 
This server received raw data from the PUBG Mobile observer and sent it to the web app, 
which automatically updated the Lottie animations and live-data tables.

## The LAN Finals

On the day of the finals, the project moved from development to live execution. 
My role was to make sure the technical side of the broadcast and the venue visuals ran perfectly.

Because I had built the automation tools beforehand, I was able to focus on the live production:

- **Real-time Graphics:** The system worked exactly as planned. When the **PUBG Mobile observer** sent match data, 
my Flask bridge caught it, and the Lottie animations updated on the stream instantly. 
This meant we had live leaderboards and player stats without any manual typing.
- **Broadcast Architecture**: I managed the full production feed, 
using **OBS** to bridge the gameplay, the automated data tables, and the tournament branding. 
I handled the routing for both the online stream and the physical screens in the venue to ensure a consistent look across the whole event.

## Conclusion

Building this system from scratch over six weeks showed me how much "Logic-First" engineering can improve a live event. 
By using **TypeScript**, **Python**, **Electron**, and **React**, 
I took a high-pressure manual job and turned it into an automated, professional broadcast.

The result was a tournament for the Georgian community that felt just as high-level as the international pro leagues.
